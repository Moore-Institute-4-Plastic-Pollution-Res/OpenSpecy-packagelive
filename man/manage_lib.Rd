\arguments{
\item{which}{a character string specifying which library to use,
\code{"raman"} or \code{"ftir"}.}

\item{location}{where to save or look for library files.}

\item{condition}{determines if \code{check_lib()} should warn
(\code{"warning"}, the default) or throw and error (\code{"error"}).}

\item{node}{the OSF node to be retrieved. Should be \code{"x7dpz"}.}

\item{conflicts}{determines what happens when a file with the same name
exists at the specified destination. Can be one of the following (see
\code{\link[osfr]{osf_download}()} for details):
\itemize{
  \item{"error"}{ throw an error and abort the file transfer operation.}
  \item{"skip"}{ skip the conflicting file(s) and continue transferring the remaining files.}
  \item{"overwrite" (default)}{ replace the existing file with the transferred copy.}
}}

\item{\ldots}{further arguments passed to \code{\link[osfr]{osf_download}()}.}

\description{
These functions will import the spectral libraries from Open Specy if they
were not already downloaded.
The CRAN does not allow for deployment of large datasets so this was a
workaround that we are using to make sure everyone can easily get Open Specy
functionality running on their desktop.
}
\details{
\code{check_lib()} checks to see if the Open Specy library already exists
on the users computer.
\code{get_lib()} will download the Open Specy Library from OSF
(\url{https://osf.io/x7dpz/}).
\code{load_lib()} will load the library into the global environment for use
with the Open Specy functions.
