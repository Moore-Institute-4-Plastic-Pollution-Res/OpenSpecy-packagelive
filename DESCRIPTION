Description: Open Specy is a Raman and (FT)IR spectral analysis tool which was first developed for microplastic spectral analysis, 
but we also will be developing it for spectral analysis more broadly. This package is live online at www.openspecy.org. 
Features currently supported focus on reading spectral files, identifying spectra using an onboard spectral library, processing spectra using baseline correction and smoothing techniques, and sharing spectra with others using metadata standards.
