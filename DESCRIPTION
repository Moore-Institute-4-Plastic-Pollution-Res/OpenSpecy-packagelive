Description: Open Specy is a Raman and (FT)IR spectral analysis tool which was
  first developed for microplastic analysis, but we also will be developing it
  for spectral analysis more broadly. A Shiny app of this package is live online
  at www.openspecy.org. Features currently supported focus on reading spectral
  files, identifying spectra using an onboard spectral library, processing
  spectra using baseline correction and smoothing techniques, as well as sharing
  spectra with others using metadata standards.
